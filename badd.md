# Bad Design
Last July, I awoke at 5am and realized the beeping noise that had enterred my dream was not a figment of my subconcious imagination. I reluctantly stumbled out of bed and traced the chirping noise to the fire alarm in my kitchen. What was the meaning of this incessant beeping? I stood on a chair and jabbed the reset button but after a pause, the beeping resumed. I sniffed the air and did not smell any burning so I concluded that there probably was not an early morning fire blazing in the apartment building. So what could the beeping be? Was it merely signalling a need for a battery change or was my apartment filled with toxic gas that was harming me as I sleepily mulled over the possible significance of the sound. I rummaged through the closets of my kitchen until I found the box where my parents store batteries and replaced the alarm's batteries silencing the noise. But I remained doubtful. What if I had just incorrectly inserted the batteries, disabling the alarm, and there still existed a toxic gas in my home, building and growing. After some thought, sleepiness triumphed over my anxiety and I stumbled back to bed.


This frightening experience was solely the result of the poor design of my fire-alarm. First of all, the noise was quiet enough to meld into my dream instead of immediately waking me up. In a true emergency, this volume would be insufficient and possibly life-threatening. In addition, the meaning of the alarm's noise was not clear. Instead of making different noises for fires, gas and insufficient battery my machine seems to emit the same chirp for all alerts even though the three situations necessitate vastly different responses from the user. Or if the alarm does make different sounds for these situations, It does not clearly explain the distinction between the noises it makes. A better designed alarm would speak to me in addition to beeping, ellucidating the meaning behind the noise.   


Asthetically, the alarm is displeasing to look at. Its plastic appearance connected to an ugly metal pipe infects the kitchen making the room look ugly and industrial. In addition, its red light periodically flashes on and off. Though this does not bother me in my kitchen, last year the fire-alarm in my dorm room kept me awake at night, interrupting the darkness and inhibiting my ability to fall asleep.
